# 🧠 Brainstorming Process 

We rely on search engines like Google or Yahoo to find information, but they **require text input**. We always have to type words or sentences to get results.

But do we really need text to search?

Emojis have evolved into a universal language, conveying emotions and meanings. So why not **search with emojis instead of text?**

We propose a **search engine where you use only emojis**—no text needed. 🍕 finds pizza places, ✈️ finds flight information.

This creates a **more intuitive and language-free search experience. Now, search without words.**

## ⚡ Process Flow

When you search using only emojis, the AI model **analyzes the intent behind your emoji search** and predicts the original text-based query. It then performs a **Google search via the Google Search API** to retrieve relevant results.

To display the results in emoji format, the system **breaks down the title and snippet into individual words** and uses AI to generate **emoji representations that preserve the original meaning.**

Now, **search with emojis and get results in emojis!**
